# HCI_interactive_media_art

<Kinekid>
본 프로젝트 인원은 총 4명으로, 한동대학교에서 ICT 융합을 전공하고 있는 4명의 학부생으로 이루어져 있습니다. 
2019학년도 1학기 HCI(이원섭 교수님)수업의 일환으로 진행중인 프로젝트입니다. 
본 프로젝트(이하 Kinekid 혹은 키넥키드)는 발달성 장애(발달 지연, 발달장애, 자폐성 스펙트럼 등)를 가진 아동을 위한 미디어 아트적 성격을 가진 게임을 만드는 프로젝트입니다. 치료용 게임이 아닌 치료를 돕는 훈련성 게임임을 알려드리며, 컨텐츠 개발을 위해 현재 관련 분야에서 종사하고 계신 사회복지사 선생님들과 특수교육학과에서 공부하고 있는 학생들을 대상으로 인터뷰 진행 및 관련 논문 자료를 참조하여 컨텐츠를 제작하였습니다. 
디바이스는 키넥트를 사용하고있고, 언어는 스크래치로 개발중에 있습니다. 
  
Our team project is Kineckid, it means Kinect + Kid. Kinekid is a developmental training program for 5-11 year-old children who had developmental disabilities. This is our project’s general process. Before we started to discuss about the project, we built 6 big steps until making high- fidelity prototype. First step is ‘Customer Definition & Issue’, second one is ‘Specialist Interview & Problem definition’ and third one is ‘Concept Ideation’. And forth is ‘Making a Prototype’, fifth is ‘Prototype Feedback’, and last one is ‘Making a high -fidelity prototype’.


1. Background
In the beginning, we discussed a lot of ideas about Kinect program. Finally, we realized that we should set one target first, and go on the process. Also, we wanted to make a game in media art that was not just a game, but socially meaningful. So we researched, and there are pretty a lot of children who have developmental disorders. Developmental disorders are diseases caused by failure to follow normal development process or by discontinuation of certain functions. The number of children with developmental disabilities continues to rise from 2013 to 2017, according to the data from the Health and Welfare Ministry's disabled registration status. However, training programs for children with developmental disabilities currently remain in utilizing 1 or 2 dimensions of data and have spatial limitations that require children to visit to relevant centers to receive training programs. Even with the exception of Seoul, access to such education is very low. And For this reason, children with developmental disabilities do not take sufficient training programs at the right time (5-11 years old) which are needed to maximize the effectiveness of their treatment. This is the statistics of the time to commute to special education school or class from home. Therefore, we are planning to develop training program for disabled children by using Kinect that can provide motion-recognition-based content. Through using this program, children can be trained their developmental status at home through interesting training programs without problem of accessibility to center.


2. Specialist Interview & Problem Definition.
 We conducted the interviews with a large framework to find out the direction of the solution and what the children need. The solution was chosen through interviews with four people, two are experts who work in center for disabled and others are students who study on special education or social welfare. We asked them four questions about current training programs for the children who have developmental disorders, necessary skills, subject opinions, and contents of Kinect for the children. Here are the common answers from interviews. They said that the learning required for disabled children is largely exercise, cognitive skills and social skills. However, the existing programs failed to provide interest to children because they focus only on education so they did not consider real users. Through the interview, we could know existing program is 'lack of fun'. It was not user-oriented, but lesson oriented. This direction made low sustainability. So we came up with the concept of 'learning programs using fairy tales‘. It will help interaction between users and programs. 
 
 
3. Concept Ideation
These are studies which can prove our project that use fairy tales. They explained effects of using fairy tale in education for children who have developmental education. They said, ‘fairy tale may be the appropriate medium for proper arbitration and reinforcement of self-expression abilities’ and ‘When storytelling is applied to cognitive and behavioral self-expression programs, the technology of self-expression can naturally be created by infants through the role experience of the main characters in fairy tales.’ Kinect, which interacts with body movements, and fairy tales will bring children freshness and fun that are different from traditional learning programs. 


4. Making a low fidelity prototype 
Through Build-Measure-Learn process, we choose three fairy tale stories which are ‘콩쥐팥쥐’, ‘아기 장수 우투리‘, ‘유기견 흰둥이의 모험＇. Based on these concept of fairy tale, low-fidelity prototype with solutions for 'recognition', 'sociality' and 'exercise‘ was developed. These are out prototype. With pilot test, we make up our paper prototype first, and we make a video about process of playing this program. 


5. Paper-prototype feedback
Since children with developmental disabilities cannot provide adequate feedback to us, so we have received feedback from three people, one expert in the field and two undergraduate students studying in this field. We sent our video and conducted online interview. Here are our strong points. It enables children to get benefits of training program at any time by provided Kinekid at home. Second is, as this program use both sound and visual image, it would help children to have better understanding.


6. Future work
Also we have weak point, some games need to be explained in detail, because disabled children have more difficulty understanding than we think. So we set derivation of two correction directions. One is adding more voice or sound and image instead of text descriptions, and the other is trying to align the level of the description to actual disabled children. Feedback will be arranged in the direction of ninth week. The goal is to implement the program through scratch language until the eleventh week.
